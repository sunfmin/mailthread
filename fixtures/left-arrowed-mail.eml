Subject: Re: Qortex Private Beta

Hey Kilian,

Sorry it's taken me so long to respond... We had some regional guys in the office this week so I was juggling a bunch of high-level meetings and dealing with a bunch of daily work stuff.

Sure - if you'd be available to come in that would be great. Maybe myself and another person can meet you - his name is Geoff Dossor and he's the head of our Proximity unit. At this point I'm just trying to find different scenarios where using Qortex makes sense - conveying information from meetings to a wider team, etc.

If you want to run us through the system that would be fine.

But to be totally honest, I suspect it may be hard to deploy this as a full communication solution for the agency here in Japan. Our IT department tends to be pretty closed, and very 'security conscious'. So they don't tend to like third part solutions.

But I'm very happy to learn more about how the software works.

Thanks,

Peter

We could also have a Q & A at the end so they would probably feel more confident about the platform, how to use it and the benefits for them.

There are no obligations, it’s just important for us to get any feedback at this early stage and also to hear first impressions, concerns directly from "the horse’s mouth". So even if we did the demo and you found that Qortex doesn’t fit your workflow, that’s fine with us. We will end up wiser either way. What do you think?

IE 8 & 9 works mostly, we just have some problems with the editor, so until these issues are fixed we highly recommend Windows users to try out Qortex on Google Chrome, Firefox or Safari. Once the IE issues are fixed they’re welcome to switch back any time.
